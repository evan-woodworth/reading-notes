This article discusses the ethics behind collecting an overabundance of data, which can be used later to make biased decisions. It explains how data used to have to be modelled with a schema, which solidifies what the data is about. Through advances of technology and a an ever shifting and expanding landscape of data collection, data can now be grabbed without preference, allowing it to be stored and used laterwith increasing ease. The article describes how this can be dangerous, citing examples of how data has been used to inform bias decisions in the past, and calling for a reform of how we collect data. I wholeheartedly agree with the notion.
